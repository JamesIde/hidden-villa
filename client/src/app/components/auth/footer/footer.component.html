        <p class="py-2">
            An ecommerce store dedicated to the author Raymond E. Feist. The
            collection of novels that formed the Riftwar Cycle remain some of
            the best fiction of the century.

            This project was created using the MERN Stack. React on the
            frontend, connected by an API written using Express with NodeJS, and
            MongoDB (with mongoose) for data storage.
        </p>
        <p className="py-2">
            This project was an opportunity for me to understand the concepts
            and logic of a shopping cart, and improve my overall fullstack
            development through trying new things like using React Query, Redux
            and Express. Some styling was done with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI
            components.
